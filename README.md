# Cliff Hangar

Cliff Hangar is a website for a fictional climbing hall located inside a repurposed hangar in Tempelhofer Feld, currently a park that used to be an airport in Berlin, Germany.
The hangars in Tempelhofer Feld are still being used for mostly social services by the goverment. It is possible that in the future these spaces will be used for sports that require a speciallized location and gear so this website helps to promote it and to offer basic information about it's services, fees and staff.
