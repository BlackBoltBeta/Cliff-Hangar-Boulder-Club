# Cliff Hangar

Cliff Hangar is a website for a fictional climbing hall located inside a repurposed hangar in Tempelhofer Feld, currently a park that used to be an airport in Berlin, Germany.
The hangars in Tempelhofer Feld are still being used for mostly social services by the government. It is possible that in the future these spaces will be used for sports that require a specialized location and gear. So this website helps to promote it and to offer basic information about its services, fees and staff.

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing receives the user with a wide image of a colorful climbing wall inside a hangar.
  - While the image is an illustration of a fictional place together with the text, it works to convey the purpose of the hall.

### Bugs and issues.

- Both submit buttons show a color matching error, I have chosen to ignore it, the color is visible enough, and I would like to keep the style as is.
- The HTML validator shows errors with repeated class attributes and <a> elements inside <ul>. I have chosen to ignore them for the time being.
